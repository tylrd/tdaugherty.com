With the extra free time, I want to explore popular open source projects and dig
into the details of the code. I'm really interested in databases and distributed
systems. I've picked a number of projects written in different languages and
covering different use cases.

## Projects

### RocksDB

RocksDB is a fast key value store.

### Lucene

Lucene is a full text search engine and the backbone of Elasticsearch.

### Prometheus

Promtheus is a time series database and used for reporting metrics.

### SQLite

SQLite is an embedded RDMS

### etcd

etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system

### Consul

Consul is service networking solution used to connect and secure services
