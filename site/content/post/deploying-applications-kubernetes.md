On the surface, Deploying applications to Kubernetes is very simple. Write some
YAML, run a command, and you're done. In reality (and production), there are
many considerations that need to be made to ensure you are safely shipping
changes to your application. A whole ecosystem of tools has been developed to
solve this problem.

This series of blog posts will cover the essentials of deploying applications to
Kubernetes. We will start with very basic Kubernetes fundamentals and then move
on to more advanced concepts and deployment strategies. Along the way, we will
see how tools in this space help us achieve deployment Nirvana.
